# 0001 - Record architecture decisions

Date: December 14, 2023

## Context

Maintaining a record of key decisions made in the project seems worthwhile.

The general idea is to record important decisions that affect the application
as a whole, for the use of future developers and maintainers.

## Decision

See <http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions>
for general motivation and format for architecture decision records (ADRs).

## Consequences

Recording architecture decisions should reduce the learning curve for new
developers and maintainers coming on the project.

There is a maintenance burden in creating ADRs, but it is expected that this will
be outweighed by the benefits.
